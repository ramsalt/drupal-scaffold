## Local environment

Write here what is the **recommended** setup process to get the site up and running. Note that the site configuration _should not allow_ to accidentally push data to production systems if the developer does not follow the instructions here, so take care that all the informations reported here must be considered _optional_.


#### Config splits

Define the config environment used to create config splits. An example could be:

- **Environment: Dev** _(Machine name: `environment_dev`)_: Enabled by default (disabled in `settings.ramsalt.prod.php`), it disables most cache modules,
  enables Devel module and database logging.


## Theming and frontend
| FRONTEND INFO   |             |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| **Base theme**      | BaseTheme Name |
| **Module bundler**  | Webpack 5 |
| **Node version**    | v14.15.4 |
| **CSS framework**   | Bootstrap 4.6 |
| **JS framework**    | Vanilla JS - jQuery 3.5.1 |
| **Additional notes**| None |

#### Theme workflow and compiling

Explain the command and the process of the theme. An example could be:

**Compilation**: Run gulp from the awesome_theme folder.


#### Theme best practices

A description of linting, component based design and how to behave in the theme


## Integrations

Define any 3rd-party integration and any notes on it here


## Hosting and deployment

This project is hosted via Wodby and connected to CircleCI, for managing the `post-script` commands, we use the `wodby.yml` file in the docroot.
Note that the production environment should always be set to the `master` branch.


#### Deployment procedure

The best practice to consider when deploying is to do your changes on `develop` branch, make a pull-request and when approved by the PM, make a database backup of the `prod` instance in Wodby, and merge with `master`.
