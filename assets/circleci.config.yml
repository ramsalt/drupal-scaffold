# If you need more deployments you can define them here.
# A couple of examples are provided, but you can add as many as needed.
#
# You can use the drupal-build-theme job, if you want to build/compile a theme on runtime and you do
# not have the compiled CSS files in GIT. The job automaticlaly runs `npm install && npm run build`
# in the specified theme folder.
#
# To enable this workflows simply uncomment the following lines and update the configuration as needed.
